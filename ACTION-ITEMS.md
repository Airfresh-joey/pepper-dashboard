## 📸 Images Needed

### Missing Images (From Your Signal Conversation):

1. **Joey's Photo** 
   - File: `assets/joey-avatar.jpg`
   - Description: Bearded man photo
   
2. **Air Fresh Marketing Logo**
   - File: `assets/airfresh-logo.png`
   - Description: Anthropic "A" in circle
   
3. **Humming Agent AI Logo**
   - File: `assets/humming-logo.png`
   - Description: Hummingbird line art
   
4. **Immerse Forge Logo**
   - File: `assets/immerse-logo.png`
   - Description: Company logo
   
5. **Street Teams Co Logo**
   - File: `assets/streetteams-logo.png`
   - Description: White text on blue background
   
6. **College Marketing Logo**
   - File: `assets/college-logo.png`
   - Description: Blue text logo

### How to Add Images:

**Option 1: Local**
```bash
# Save images to this directory:
cd ~/clawd/dashboard/assets/

# Name them exactly as shown above
# Then re-deploy:
cd ~/clawd/dashboard
vercel --prod
```

**Option 2: Extract from Signal**
The images were sent via Signal. Check:
- Signal Desktop attachments folder
- Recent conversation history
- Downloads folder

**Note:** The dashboard has SVG fallbacks, so it looks professional even without the images!
