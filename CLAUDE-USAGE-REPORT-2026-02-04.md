**Dashboard Updated:** ✅

- **Monthly Tokens (Feb 1-4):** 150,638,355 tokens
- **Monthly Spend:** $161.61 (100% of $50 budget)
- **Remaining Balance:** $0.00

## Status
🚨 **BUDGET EXCEEDED** - Monthly spending has exceeded the $50 limit by $111.61

## Files Updated
- `claude-usage.json` — Machine-readable metrics (updated 02:00 AM)
- `claude-usage.html` — Live HTML dashboard at `file:///Users/joeymacmini/clawd/dashboard/claude-usage.html`

## Data Sources
- Scanned: 190 session files from `~/.clawdbot/agents/main/sessions/`
- Token extraction: JSONL transcripts with usage metadata
- Cost calculation: Haiku model pricing ($3/1M input, $15/1M output)

## Recommendations
1. **Review session sizes** — 150M tokens in 4 days suggests large contexts or many concurrent sessions
2. **Check model selection** — Verify we're using efficient models for routine tasks
3. **Archive old sessions** — Large session files may be inflating token counts
4. **Plan budget** — Consider monthly budget allocation for remaining month

## Next Update
Scheduled via cron: Hourly during business hours (8am-6pm MDT)
