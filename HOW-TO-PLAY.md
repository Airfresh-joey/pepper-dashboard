## 🎯 THE RULES

### Rule #1: Everything Is a Quest
Every task you need to do = a quest worth XP (experience points)

**Quest Types:**
- 🔴 **Main Quests** - Big important stuff (email setup, major projects) → 500-1000 XP
- 🟡 **Side Quests** - Important but not urgent (integrations, optimizations) → 200-500 XP  
- 🟢 **Daily Quests** - Repeatable daily tasks (morning briefing, check-ins) → 50-100 XP
- 🟣 **Power Quests** - Advanced challenges (security, automation) → 750-2000 XP

### Rule #2: Check Boxes = Points
Every time you complete a task, you earn XP and level up your score

```
[x] Task done → Points added automatically
```

### Rule #3: Streaks Multiply Rewards
Complete daily quests multiple days in a row = streak bonuses!

```
Day 1: +100 XP
Day 2: +110 XP (+10 streak bonus)
Day 3: +120 XP (+20 streak bonus)
Day 7: +160 XP (+60 streak bonus) + 🏅 ACHIEVEMENT
```

### Rule #4: Achievements Unlock Power-Ups
Hit milestones → Unlock achievements → Get special abilities

**Example:**
- Unlock "Email Warrior" → Get access to auto-responses
- Unlock "Week Warrior" → Get Sprint Mode power-up
- Unlock "CEO Mode" → Get Agent Army deployment

### Rule #5: Points = Progress = Dopamine
Watch your score go up = feel good about getting shit done
