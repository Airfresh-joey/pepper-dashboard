## ✅ ACTION ITEMS (Priority Order)

### 🔴 Immediate (Today)
1. **Contact Anthropic Support** - Escalate budget overage
   - Check billing account status
   - Request temporary limit increase if available
   - Discuss prepaid credit options

2. **Review Recent Sessions** - Identify what drove usage
   - Check which tools/operations used the most tokens
   - Look for loops, retries, or inefficient patterns
   - Document findings

3. **Implement Brakes** - Stop the bleeding NOW
   - Disable non-essential operations (heavy web scraping, image analysis)
   - Switch to Haiku-only mode for lower-cost operations
   - Set token budgets per session/task

### 🟡 Short-term (This Week)
1. **Optimize Usage Patterns**
   - Cache frequently needed data
   - Batch operations where possible
   - Use shorter context windows
   - Archive old sessions (6,469 session files = I/O overhead)

2. **Implement Token Tracking**
   - Real-time alerts at 50%, 75%, 100% of budget
   - Per-operation cost estimates
   - Weekly spending reviews

3. **Update Pricing Model**
   - Re-evaluate token allocation (50/month may be too low)
   - Plan for sustainable monthly budget based on actual needs

## 📈 Usage Patterns (Feb 1-4)

```
Feb 1 (Morning)  → ~25M tokens
Feb 2 (Day 1)    → ~31M tokens  ← Heavy usage day
Feb 3 (Day 2)    → ~35M tokens  ← Peak usage day
Feb 4 (Night)    → Continuing  ← Account depleted
```

**Key Observation:** Usage ramped up significantly on Feb 2-3, suggesting either:
- New workflows/processes started
- Increased volume of operations
- Inefficient patterns emerged
- Background processes running continuously

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Cost Reduction Strategies
1. **Use Haiku for Simple Tasks** (saves 80% on output costs)
   - Email drafting
   - Simple data processing
   - Routine checks
   - Estimated savings: $100+/month

2. **Implement Caching**
   - Cache API responses (weather, calendar, etc.)
   - Reuse previous analysis results
   - Estimated savings: $30+/month

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Group multiple tasks into single API call
   - Reduce conversation overhead
   - Estimated savings: $20+/month

4. **Archive Sessions**
   - Move old session files to archive
   - Reduces I/O overhead
   - Keeps tracker responsive

### New Budget Allocation
- **Recommended:** $150-200/month for sustainable operations
- **Current trajectory:** $469/month (unsustainable)
- **With optimizations:** ~$80-100/month (feasible)
