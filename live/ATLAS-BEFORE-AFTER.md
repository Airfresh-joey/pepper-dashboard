# 🤖 ATLAS - Before vs. After

**The difference between manual outreach and Atlas**

---

## 📧 Email Outreach

### ❌ BEFORE (Manual/Template)

```
Subject: Grow Your Business with HummingAgent

Hi [First Name],

We help companies like yours automate operations and save time.

Our AI agents can handle customer service, sales, and more.

Would you be interested in a demo?

Best,
Joey
```

**Problems:**
- Generic subject line (goes to spam)
- No research on prospect
- Template detected easily
- No personalization
- Low response rate (<1%)

---

### ✅ AFTER (Atlas)

```
Subject: Houston expansion + back-office efficiency

Hi Jeremy,

Saw Anslow Bryant is pushing past $30M with the Houston 
expansion — congrats on the growth.

We help construction firms automate the back-office headaches 
that come with scaling — proposals, project tracking, client 
communication.

Worth a 15-min call to see if there's a fit?

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Subject references specific intel (Houston expansion)
- ✅ First line shows real research
- ✅ Industry-specific language ("construction firms", "back-office")
- ✅ Personalized calendar link
- ✅ Conversational, peer-to-peer tone
- ✅ Clear CTA with low friction

**Expected response rate:** 3-5% (3-5x better)

## 🔍 Research Process

### ❌ BEFORE (Manual)

**Time per prospect:** 5-10 minutes (if you actually do it)

**Process:**
1. Google the company
2. Maybe check LinkedIn
3. Skim website
4. Hope you find something interesting

**Result:** Surface-level, often missed

---

### ✅ AFTER (Atlas)

**Time per prospect:** 2 minutes (automated)

**Process:**
1. Apollo data (company size, revenue, tech stack)
2. Website scrape (services, recent activity)
3. LinkedIn profile (background, interests, posts)
4. Google News (recent press, awards, expansions)
5. Trigger events (funding, hiring, growth)

**Result:** Deep intel, actionable hooks

**Example output:**
```json
{
  "company": "Anslow Bryant",
  "intel": {
    "revenue": "$30M+",
    "employees": "75",
    "recent_news": "Houston expansion Q4 2025",
    "pain_points": ["scaling operations", "back-office efficiency"],
    "tech_stack": ["QuickBooks", "Procore"]
  },
  "hooks": [
    "Recent expansion to Houston",
    "Growing fast ($30M revenue)",
    "Likely needs automation for scale"
  ]
}
```
