# 🤖 ATLAS - AI Employee Demo (Executive Summary)

**Created:** February 4, 2026 @ 7:01 AM MST  
**Ready to Build:** ✅ YES  
**Time to Launch:** 8-12 hours  

---

## What It Does (30-Second Version)

**ATLAS** = Autonomous sales agent that runs 24/7

1. **Finds prospects** on Apollo (construction CEOs, IT service owners, etc.)
2. **Researches each one** (website, LinkedIn, news, trigger events)
3. **Generates personalized messages** using AI (every email unique)
4. **Sends outreach** (email + LinkedIn) with your approval
5. **Updates website** with personalized landing pages + calendar links
6. **Follows up automatically** (multi-touch cadence)
7. **Books meetings** straight to your calendar
8. **Lives on your dashboard** under "Labs" with real-time activity

---

## Why This Is Different

**Not another email blaster.** This is a full AI employee that:
- Actually researches each prospect (2 min per person, like the playbook says)
- Writes genuinely personal messages (not templates)
- Creates custom landing pages per prospect
- Learns and improves over time
- Runs while you sleep

**Example:**
```
Atlas finds: Jeremy Anslow, CEO of Anslow Bryant (construction)
Atlas researches: $30M revenue, Houston expansion, growing fast
Atlas writes: "Hi Jeremy, saw Anslow Bryant is pushing past $30M 
              with the Houston expansion — congrats on the growth..."
Atlas creates: hummingagent.ai/atlas/anslow-bryant (custom page)
Atlas sends: Email with personalized calendar link
Atlas follows up: Days 7 and 14 if no response
Result: Meeting booked or marked closed-lost
```
